    "\n",
    "The advise I can supply towards the school is the following: while adding coffee machines does definitely help the amount of drinks a student can drink it does not necessarily correlate with the amount of time spent in class. Config 1 has more coffee machines than Config 2 however Config 2 also has twice as many students which results in a longer queue time and a shorter time spent in class\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is why we introduce schedule. Lets view config's 4 and 5. With config 4 the amount of drinks a student could get during the day is much lower than every other config, this is because of the amount of students which is why with config 5 we combine every option: more coffee machines, more students, using schedule and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to expand this project? \n",
    "\n",
    "I think that upgrading characteristics for students would increase realism as currently students will get as much drinks on a day as they want. Which can result in to unhealthy amounts of coffee. Furthermore focussing on scheduling of the students day and scheduling coffee breaks can help further improve coffee gathering performance"
